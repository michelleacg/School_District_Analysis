## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Maria the Chief Data Scientist for a City School District is responsible for analyzing data from a variety of resources and a variety of formats to present performance trends and patterns used for informed discussions and decisions. Our role is to help Maria on student funding and students standardized test scores. Access has been granted to all the math and reading scores, and will assist the School Board making decisions regarding the Budgets and Priorities. 

After revuew tge file shows evidence of academic dishonesty regarding reading and math grades for Thomas High School 9th grade, so the School Board would like to uphold state-testing standards. The math and reading scores had to be replaced with NaNs maintaining the rest of the data intact. The results of this change will be presented as well.
